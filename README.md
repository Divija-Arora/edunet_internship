#### WEEK-2 - I mounted the dataset directly from Google Drive into Google Colab, ensuring seamless and persistent access. I analyzed image dimensions to identify inconsistencies and detected duplicate images using MD5 hashing, which helped clean the dataset for better model performance. Additionally, I applied real-time data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, shear, and horizontal flipping using ImageDataGenerator, along with proper training-validation splits. These steps collectively improved data quality and prepared the dataset for robust model training.
